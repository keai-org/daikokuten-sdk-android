/home/dononefallen/Development/kaindi/daikokuten/sdk/android/library/build.gradle:23: Warning: A newer version of androidx.constraintlayout:constraintlayout than 2.1.4 is available: 2.2.1 [GradleDependency]

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

            settings.javaScriptEnabled = true
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "SetJavaScriptEnabled":
   Your code should not invoke setJavaScriptEnabled if you are not sure that
   your app really requires JavaScript support.

/home/dononefallen/Development/kaindi/daikokuten/sdk/android/library/src/main/res/layout/chat_button_layout.xml:12: Warning: Hardcoded string "ðŸ’¬", should use @string resource [HardcodedText]
        android:text="ðŸ’¬"
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "HardcodedText":
   Hardcoding text attributes directly in layout files is bad for several
   reasons:

   * When creating configuration variations (for example for landscape or
   portrait) you have to repeat the actual text (and keep it up to date when
   making changes)

   * The application cannot be translated to other languages by just adding
   new translations for existing string resources.

   There are quickfixes to automatically extract this hardcoded string into a
   resource lookup.
